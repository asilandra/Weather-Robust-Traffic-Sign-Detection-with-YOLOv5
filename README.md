# Weather-Robust-Traffic-Sign-Detection-with-YOLOv5
This project implements a deep learning pipeline to improve the robustness of traffic sign detection for autonomous vehicles in adverse weather conditions. Using the YOLOv5 architecture and the GTSRB dataset, we explore the impact of synthetic weather augmentations (fog, rain, lighting shifts) on model performance.
